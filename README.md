# Bad-To-Good Todo List Project

## Overview

This is a **Todo List** project designed for learning JavaScript. 
The goal of this project is to build a basic, intentionally "bad" version of a Todo list, leaving plenty of room for **upgrades** and improvements. 

Please improve the code as a way of practicing new skills and tackling real-world JavaScript challenges.
